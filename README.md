# Dijkstra graph visualizer
This repository contains a graph visualizer implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The visualizer provides an interactive way to explore and understand the algorithm's behavior on different graph topologies.

Features:

- Interactive graph visualization
